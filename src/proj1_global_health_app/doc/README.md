# Global Health Data Analysis
In this exercise data on global health and nutrition is analysed. In particular

- life-expectancy per country is visualized in a global map
- correlations between nutrition-facts, such as daily calories consumption per capita, and life-expectancy is analysed
- machine-learning models to predict life-expectancy from nutrition features are trained
  countries are clustered according to their nutrition-development within the last 50 years
