# Genetic Algorithms (GA)
_____________________________

* are inspired by Charels Darwin's Natural Selection Theory
* aims to find optimal solutions for problems, we don't yet know much about.
* is based on three concepts "selection, reproduction and mutation"

Idea: We generate a random set of individuals, select the best ones, cross them over and finally, slightly mutate the result (over and over again) until we find an acceptable solution.

1. Step: Generate an initial population. A _population_ or generatioin is the current set of possible solutions, called _individuals_.
